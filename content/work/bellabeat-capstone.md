This capstone project analyzes smart device usage data to provide insights for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company. Using R and the tidyverse package (dplyr, ggplot2), I explored user trends and proposed data-driven recommendations for Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.

## Dataset Source
This dataset was originally made available on Kaggle:
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It was also included as part of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). 

Note: The dataset may be outdated; my conclusion includes recommendations for conducting a new survey.
