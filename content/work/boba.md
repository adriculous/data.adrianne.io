This project demonstrates how I cleaned and transformed a dataset of boba tea sales using SQL and spreadsheet tools. We explore the process of converting raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis using Google Sheets.

## Dataset Source
Provided by the [Google Data Analytics Professoinal Certificate Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

> **Note:** While the dataset description only mentioned "boba shops," it became clear during exploration that all businesses were located in the **San Francisco Bay Area**, based on their addresses and names. According to the assignment instructions, the dataset was sourced from **Yelp reviews and ratings**, and interestingly, I recognized many of the shopsâ€”including **Che-Lo** (a Vietnamese banh mi and boba cafe in Union City), which ranked #1.
