This project focused on cleaning and normalizing a classic automotive dataset from 1985. The dataset included specifications for various cars such as horsepower, fuel type, origin, and mileage (mpg). The raw data had several inconsistencies â€” missing values, improper data types, and duplicate entries.

Using SQL queries in BigQuery, I performed data cleaning by:

- Replacing `?` placeholder values with NULLs
- Casting numeric fields like `horsepower` and `mpg` into proper data types
- Removing or deduplicating rows with conflicting entries
- Normalizing text-based categories for consistency

After cleaning, the dataset became more reliable for future analysis. This foundational step ensures better results in future data visualization and modeling tasks.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Google BigQuery
