For the longest time, **adrianne.io** didn’t have anything on it. I first purchased the domain intending it to become my new portfolio, but real life happened, and I never had the time or motivation to build it out. It was originally going to be my web development portfolio. However, I eventually found a different path.

In 2023, I decided to shift from web development to data analytics. Thanks to my employer’s education benefit, I enrolled in courses and discovered that data analysts (and data scientists) were also expected to have portfolios. I wasn’t ready for that yet, but rather than relying on a free-hosted, pre-built site, I used a pre-made HTML template and temporarily hosted it at **adrianne.io**.

I completed my Data Analytics program in October 2023. However, I never finished the capstone project. With peak season approaching at work, I couldn’t dedicate myself to the program’s job success track, so I decided to hold off until I was ready to fully commit to job searching.

Two years later, I discovered AI. After launching my new prompt engineering portfolio, [Prompted by Adrianne](https://ai.adrianne.io), it no longer made sense to leave my (temporary) data analytics portfolio sitting at **adrianne.io**. That’s when I decided to give data analytics its own official home: **data.adrianne.io**.

Along with rebuilding this portfolio, I finally committed to completing my long-overdue capstone project. Knowing the site would take time to build, I chose to finish the capstone first, then move on to the portfolio design itself.

At long last, here we are: welcome to the **adrianne.io** family, *Patterned by Adrianne*!

## Why *Patterned by Adrianne*?

When I launched [*Prompted by Adrianne*](https://ai.adrianne.io), I realized I wanted to carry the same structure across my portfolios: **Patterned by Adrianne**. Each site could reflect a different focus area, anchored by a verb that begins with “P.” It’s a fun way to keep my brand cohesive while also leaving room to grow. Who knows how many “P” verbs I’ll get through in the future?

For this portfolio, “Patterned” felt right. Data analytics is about discovering and making sense of patterns — after we’ve gathered, cleaned, and prepared the data, the real story comes from identifying what those patterns mean. Naming this space *Patterned by Adrianne* ties the process directly to what I do here.

And of course, the letter “P” is personal, too — it’s the initial of my family name. So in a way, *Adrianne P.* becomes not just a signature, but a framework: Adrianne prompts, patterns, probes, previews, pixels, and more.

## What will be in *Patterned by Adrianne*?

Before I even knew what “data analytics” was, I was already practicing it in small ways. While taking coding courses at [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com), I started with JavaScript and WordPress, and later enrolled in their Python track. That’s where I was introduced to tools like Flask, Jinja, Pandas, and matplotlib. Some of my early code-along projects unexpectedly turned into my very first data analytics experiments — long before I thought of them that way.

This portfolio brings those legacy projects together with new work:

- **Data cleaning projects** that uncover clarity from messy datasets
- **Visualization projects** that make insights easier to understand
- **Capstones** that pull together end-to-end analysis
- **Original projects** sparked by curiosity or real-world challenges

I’ll also be sharing reflections on how **AI tools intersect with analytics** — from accelerating workflows to opening new ways of interpreting data.

## Why the bunny theme in a data analytics portfolio? 🐇📊

At first glance, bunnies might seem like an odd choice for a data analytics portfolio mascot. But hear me out:

- **Bunnies multiply fast — just like data.**  
  A single rabbit pair can produce dozens of offspring in a year. Similarly, one dataset can quickly expand into thousands or even millions of rows once you start collecting and combining sources.

- **Bunnies represent curiosity and alertness.**  
  Rabbits are always aware of their surroundings, quick to notice patterns in the environment — much like how analysts need to spot trends, anomalies, and insights within raw data.

- **Bunnies dig deep.**  
  Just as rabbits burrow below the surface, data analysts dig beneath surface-level numbers to uncover hidden stories.

So while the bunny adds a playful touch, it also symbolizes the very essence of analytics: growth, curiosity, and going deeper to find meaning.

## Closing Thoughts

What started as a temporary experiment has now become a permanent home for my analytics journey. I look forward to filling *Patterned by Adrianne* with meaningful projects, thoughtful analysis, and ongoing reflections about the power of data.
