## 💙 About Me

> "Small progress is still progress."

Hello, I’m **Adrianne** — a data-loving creative, prompt engineer, and lifelong learner from the San Francisco Bay Area.  

I’ve always been a **Jill of many trades**, driven by curiosity and the desire to build things that are both beautiful and functional. My creative journey started in **graphic design and web development**, where I learned how visuals shape understanding. But as I created websites and dashboards, I realized what fascinated me most wasn’t just how things *looked* — it was the *patterns* underneath them. Why did people click here and not there? Why did one design perform better than another?  

That curiosity became the bridge to my next chapter: **data analytics** — the art of turning questions into insights.

## 🌸 My Journey into Data

Working in a warehouse environment helped me discover new strengths: observation, problem-solving, and an eye for process efficiency. It was a very different world from design, but it taught me how small details can shape big outcomes.  

When I enrolled in the **Google Data Analytics Certificate** through **Merit America**, I found a new kind of creativity — one that lives in spreadsheets, SQL queries, and visual dashboards. Cleaning messy data, uncovering trends, and communicating results felt like design in another form: painting pictures with numbers.  

Through projects like analyzing wellness trends, bike-share patterns, and global emissions, I learned how data connects **human behavior, design, and decision-making.**  

Now, I use **AI tools** as part of my process — not to replace human insight, but to **enhance exploration**:  
- Automating repetitive tasks so I can focus on meaning.  
- Using language models for code explanation, visualization ideas, and storytelling.  
- Practicing **ethical prompt engineering** to make AI an honest collaborator, not a shortcut.

## 💻 About This Portfolio

This site, **Patterned by Adrianne**, is my data storytelling portfolio — a creative space where analytics meets art and ethics. It was originally hosted on my main domain, *adrianne.io*, using a pre-made theme. I had planned to rebuild it from the ground up when it was first published, but because of life and other events, it took nearly two years to finally bring that plan to life.

I’m also deeply interested in ethical and responsible AI, especially through the lens of **prompt engineering**. My ethical AI and prompt engineering lab, [**Prompted by Adrianne**](https://ai.adrianne.io), explores how we can use AI thoughtfully and responsibly. My [Ethical AI Manifesto](https://ai.adrianne.io/about/manifesto/) — which also guides this portfolio — outlines the same principles I apply in my data work.

Together, they show how I approach analytics with empathy, curiosity, and responsibility. I believe every dataset tells a story — and my role is to translate it into something that informs *and* inspires.

## 🐇 The Bun-Bun Data Lab

Say hello to **Robot Bun-Bun**, my cheerful lab assistant! 🐇💻  
He represents curiosity, creativity, and care — the same values that guide my work in both data analytics and AI.  

In this lab, we chase patterns, test ideas, and learn from every dataset that hops our way.

### 💡 My Core Beliefs

- **Data should tell human stories.** Behind every number is a person, a decision, or a moment that matters.  
- **AI should assist, not replace.** Technology should make us *more creative and ethical*, not less human.  
- **Learning never stops.** Every project — even the small ones — is another chance to grow, adapt, and create meaning.

## 🕰️ Legacy Projects

Before fully stepping into data analytics and AI, I began learning the fundamentals of data exploration and visualization through small but meaningful projects during my [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com) program. These repositories mark the starting point of my curiosity in finding human stories within data:

- [**Happiness & Work Relationships**](https://github.com/adriculous/happiness-work-relationships) — exploring how workplace relationships can influence happiness using Python and Seaborn.  
- [**Titanic Survival Dataset**](https://github.com/adriculous/titanic-survival-dataset) — analyzing survival factors from the classic Titanic dataset using Pandas and Seaborn.  

While they’re simple by design, these projects remind me where my passion for data storytelling first took root — transforming raw datasets into visual narratives that reflect real human experiences.
