      <title>Rebuilding My Data Analytics Portfolio</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, &lt;strong&gt;adrianne.io&lt;/strong&gt; didn’t have anything on it. I first purchased the domain intending it to become my new portfolio, but real life happened, and I never had the time or motivation to build it out. It was originally going to be my web development portfolio. However, I eventually found a different path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, I decided to shift from web development to data analytics. Thanks to my employer’s education benefit, I enrolled in courses and discovered that data analysts (and data scientists) were also expected to have portfolios. I wasn’t ready for that yet, but rather than relying on a free-hosted, pre-built site, I used a pre-made HTML template and temporarily hosted it at &lt;strong&gt;adrianne.io&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
