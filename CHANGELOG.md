## V.2 - 2025.10.21
- Redid the layout to horizontal navbar instead of sidebar. It was very difficult to create a toggable sidebar on mobile view after several attempts. I feel that the new layout would be much cleaner, easier to navigate, and will work well on both desktop and mobile views.
- Added Font Awesome icons on the menu items.
- Added `Colophon` link in the footer, leading to the main *Colophon* page on *Portal by Adrianne*, instead of creating a separate *Colophon* page.
